              <h2>🥚 What Is Eggy Car?</h2>
              <p>
                Eggy Car is a simple yet addictive physics-based driving game
                created by Beedo Games. The player's goal is to drive a car
                across hilly terrain while balancing a fragile egg on top. If
                the egg cracks, the game is over.
              </p>
              <p>
                Because of its easy controls and silly challenge, Eggy Car has
                become a favorite in classrooms and on Chromebooks.

                <li>
                  <span class="education-icon">🔬</span>
                  <strong>Physics & Gravity</strong> – Kids see how momentum,
                  slopes, and gravity affect the car and egg.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="education-icon">🧩</span>
                  <strong>Problem-Solving</strong> – Learning when to
                  accelerate, brake, or use power-ups.
